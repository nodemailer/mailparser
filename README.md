# noinfopath-mailparser

Forked from the original nodemailer/mailparser project, which is now deprecated.  Maintaining here because a project we have has a dependency on it.

# NB! This project is deprecated

All users of this project are urged to find an alternative as it is not maintained anymore. Read more [here](https://blog.nodemailer.com/2018/03/11/spring-cleaning/)

# mailparser

![Nodemailer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/master/assets/nm_logo_200x136.png)

Advanced email parser for Node.js. Everything is handled as a stream which should make it able to parse even very large messages (100MB+) with relatively low overhead.

See [mailparser homepage](https://nodemailer.com/extras/mailparser/) for documentation and terms.
